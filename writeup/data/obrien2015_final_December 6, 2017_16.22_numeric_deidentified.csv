Counterintuitive as it may seem, to feel a painful emotion fully, at the site of its delivery, is the best way to help it diminish. Not feeling the emotion, on the other hand, causes it to grow stronger, remain longer, and mess up our lives in many ways.  But emotions are inside of us, so we can't actually run away from them.

I can also do other things instead of worrying about driving. I spend my day at work and then I go home and spend time with my family. I love my family; my wife and kids. It's almost always a good time to spend time with them. Sometimes they have their moments, but all in all it's a pleasure being a husband and father. On the weekends I change up my routine a bit. I usually go for a longer run on Saturday mornings since I have more time. On Sundays I attend a lot of church meetings.

When or if the human population hits a certain point, there are very good reasons to believe that a pandemic illness or even mass sterility will come to the fore to act as brakes on further growth.Finally, the rather bizarre push for artificial intelligence will probably create one or more intelligences that mankind will almost certainly not be able to control.

No only did I not care about their flaws when I was young, I didn't see them as flaws at all, I didn't think negatively of their bad traits, because I didn't know they were bad traits. I would be better at forgiving and forgetting, and be able to maintain a much closer and more healthy relationship because of this.

That person was necessary because that person was being squeezed by taxation and demands for money. That person had no choice. That person had to survive, being squeezed by entities that are criminal and legal, or a combination of the two. My past self was good at businness. Identifiying and exploiting people to take money from them. A barbaric practice that includes deception and sometimes immoral behaviour, such as lying and decepetion. This person was drivin. This person would rise early and work late. The past person was very concerned about obtaining a way to provide for others and gain more than I was spending at the time. This person motivates the present person now because this past person is someone that I do not want to be anymore. So that past person is a template of someone that I can view in my mind and try to avoid being. I can always remember that person, everyday, and try to avoid doing that again and being that past person.

I hope you‰Ûªre not miserable waking up every morning. And if you are, do me a favor: change something. Change whatever is making you unhappy. Choose happiness.I hope you have traveled. If not, I am extremely disappointed in you. I hope you have been to Ireland, and to Italy, and to Greece. I hope you have been to California, and South Carolina, and all over the U.S. by now. If you haven‰Ûªt, what are you doing with your life? (I‰Ûªm going to guess you‰Ûªre still poor).I hope you still know how amazing our family is. I hope that you still know that family comes before everything else. I hope you still know that family will always be there for you, every single time.

I hope you still think of them often.I hope you are still learning lessons, and still making mistakes. Because if you‰Ûªre not, life is probably pretty boring. If you‰Ûªre not learning lessons and making mistakes it‰Ûªs probably because you‰Ûªre not taking risks. If that‰Ûªs the case, take more risks. Please.

How could you do that to us? Red glasses, really? You couldn't have just gone with black? I know that you wanted to be unique, but we were stuck with those glasses for years. Honestly, I wonder if I should blame you, or our mom who let us walk out of the store with them.But at least you stuck to yourself. I'll give you props for that. It can be hard trying to stay true to yourself. At least in high school it is. We went through some pretty crazy phases, especially the weird hipster phase. Good thing that's over with.You don't have to look and act a certain way to impress people. I wish I could've learned that sooner. You didn't need to have hair feathers in middle school because everybody had them. If you liked them, then sure, but don't try lying to me. I know that you regretted getting them every time you brushed your hair.Speaking of middle school, honestly, don't even try. No matter how cute your clothes were or who your friends were or how you acted, you'll hate yourself. Everybody ends up hating their middle school self, it's just a given. Puberty, transitioning between elementary to middle school, and the fashion alone ... middle school selves are the worst. Now I'm not saying that I hated myself right after middle school. Of course not. It took years to realize that middle school was the most awkward time of our life and we sort of just want to forget about it.Past self, all of those things that we wanted to do but thought we were too old or it wasn't cool enough or nobody else wanted to do it with us? We should have just done it. Remember when you thought it'd be cool to be a cheerleader? You should've tried out, it could've been so much fun! And if it wasn't, you always could've quit rather than always wonder if you could've done it. Or at sixth-grade camp, you were so sure that you were afraid of heights that you didn't climb the rock wall, man do I wish you did.But there are some things that I really appreciate you doing for me. Choosing the IB program, for example, who knows who we'd be without those crazy two years? We definitely wouldn't be who we are now. Or figuring out that you wanted to be a writer and not a vet ... we'd be miserable in vet school.All and all, past self, I know that there will be times when I hate you (let me just bring up the whole red glasses situation again), but there will never be times when I regret you. Everything you did and didn't do made us into who we are today. And, honestly, in comparison to who we could have been, where we are today is amazing.",2.307,21.302,23.826,3,30,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,5,5,4,4,2,,7,,26,3,2,,184,pastrational
