#Assignment


##Justification

My intended first-year project with Hazel Markus is to investigate phenomenon we're calling "self-switching" wherein people can intentionally engage in specific ways of being to change their behavior. In other words, we want to investigate how people can intentionally be the kind of person they want to in any given situation. For example, right now we are piloting a study in which participants switch on their creative self to help them succeed at a creativity task. 

One of the closest paradigmns to self-switching is role-playing or role-modeling a past or future self (Pronin & Ross, 2006; O'Brien, 2015). I have chosen to replicate O'Brien (2015) study 4, in which participants use either their past or future self as a guide to behavior when deciding how many photos of a slideshow to view. Using these selves as a behavioral guide is very similar to self-switching. As such it is directly relevant to my FYP. In addition, I am interested in what the study purports to find, namely whether we asssociate our past selves with emotionality and our future selves with rationality.

###Justification sub-note

I should note that O'Brien (2015) describes the study 4 manipulation as a "role **model**" manipulation as participants had to "keep this other self in mind as a guide in performing subsequent tasks in the study" (p.632). This is slightly different from "role **playing**", a manipulation used in study 3, in which "participants were asked to 'role-play' as this past or future self and perform subsequent tasks as if this other self had come into the lab" (p.630). Given study 4 but not study 3 had a behavioral DV of the kind Hazel & I are interested in, I chose to replicate study 4 not study 3.


##Stimuli & Procedures

This study employs a 2 x 2 design, in which participants are told to use either their past or future self as a role model for a task that is presented either as assessing their capacity for "emotionality" or "rationality". The task itself involved looking at photos as part of a 10-photo slideshow in which participants could exit at any time. The DV was how many photos they clicked through.

Participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The role-modeling manipulation consisted of having participants reflect on either their past or future self in an open-ended response (the actual instructions for this response is included in the paper). Participants were then told to keep this self in mind as a guide when performing a subsequent task.

Then, participants were told that they were to to do a task about enjoyment ("fun" condition) or critical thinking ("self-control" condition). For the fun condition, participants were asked to  look at each photo and type "ok" after they had "sufficiently enjoyed" the photo; they were told that the more photos they clicked through, the higher their "fun score" would be. For the self-control condition, participants were asked to perform a challenging calculation about the contents; they were told that the more photos they clicked through, the higher their "self-control" score would be. The paper provides the links to the photos, as well as the instructions on each page of the slideshow.

Finally, participants were asked three self-report questions to assess the difficulty of imagining their other self, the detail of this self, and how far away this self seemed. The text of the questions was provided.


###Challenges

* Stimuli
    + While the links 10 photos that comprised the slideshow were included, 3 of the 10 links did not work. Hopefully they are still in on the internet.

* Appearance
    + It is unclear how exactly the slideshow appeared to participants (while it is described, with the appropriate instructions, it is not fully clear).

* Content (while this paper thoroughly describes what they did, the paper does not always explicitly record what exactly what was written)
    + The cover story on Mechanical Turk was not provided
    + It is not clear how the task itself was described (the paper says "participants thought the task was about enjoyment ... other participants thought the task was about critical thinking", but it is unclear which words were actually used to describe the task.
    + It is not clear what exactly participants were told prior to the open-ended response.
    + It is not clear if other questions were asked (paper did not say, for instance, "we collected no other measures")
    
* Programming
    + I plan to program this in Javascript to challenge myself. I can see this taking a bit of time, but worthwhile in the end.
