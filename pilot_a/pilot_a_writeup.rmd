#### Overview

Replication of Study 4 by Sample & Sample (2015, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General)

#### Changes to Make For Pilot B

* Stimuli

* Measures
    
* Attenion Check
    + Add an attention check? I am not sure what the best attention check is to add

* Variable naming
    + Add flowers time & DV

##Power Analysis

The original authors used a MANOVA when looking at one outcome variable (the number of trials completed) and two factors each with two levels (role model -- past or future self; task -- fun or self-control). With the consultation with Ian, we decided to do a two-way ANOVA.

For effect size, I converted a partial eta squared value 0.05 (I used the eta squared value reported in the paper of 0.05, which we can assume are the same) to cohen's f using G*Power. I used alpha = 0.001 as they found a signifance less than 0.001. I used a total sample size of 224. The numerator DF was 1 (per paper; also (2-1) times (2-1) for a two way anova). And the number of groups is 4.

###From original paper

One participant reported confusion because the photos did not load properly. Excluding this participant does not meaningfully affect the results, so the entire sample was retained. Data were submitted to a univariate MANOVA, with Task and Role Model as fixed factors. Number of trials completed before quitting was the dependent variable.

There was no effect of role model (p = .43), and an incidental effect of task such that participants completed more “fun” tasks (M = 5.92) than “self-control” tasks (M = 4.06), F(1, 220) = 19.91, p < .001,  eta squared = .08. Importantly, this effect was qualified by a predicted interaction with role model, F(1, 220) = 12.45, p < .001,  eta squared = .05 (see Figure 3). For the fun version of the task, participants motivated by their past self completed more trials (M = 6.90, SD = 3.57) than did participants motivated by their future self (M ! 5.03, SD ! 3.43), F(1, 220) ! 9.95, p ! .002, "2 ! .04. However, for the self-control version of the task, future-motivated participants (M ! 4.63, SD ! 2.97) completed more trials than past-motivated participants (M ! 3.45, SD ! 2.74), F(1, 220) ! 3.52, p ! .06, "2 ! .016. 

Finally, for control variables, “past” versus “future” participants did not differ by level of detail (Mpast ! 5.31, Mfuture ! 5.25; p ! .75), difficulty in imagination (Mpast ! 2.88, Mfuture ! 2.80; p ! .77), or subjective distance (Mpast ! 4.10, Mfuture ! 4.16; p ! .78). There were effects of task, however, such that “self-control” participants felt their other selves were harder to imagine (M ! 3.13) than “fun” participants (M ! 2.56), F(1, 220) ! 5.63, p ! .018, "2 ! .02, and farther away (M ! 4.47) than “fun” participants (M ! 3.79), F(1, 220) ! 8.93, p ! .003, "2 ! .04 (detail ratings did not differ, Mselfcontrol ! 5.02, Mfun ! 5.35; p ! .48). Importantly, when entering these items as covariates in the model, all results were essentially identical: The critical interaction remained significant, F(1, 217) ! 11.45, p ! .001, "2 ! .05, as did the reported contrasts for the fun task, F(1, 217) ! 8.98, p ! .003, "2 ! .04, and for the self-control task, F(1, 217) ! 3.35, p ! .068, "2 ! .015. 


### Simplified analysis plan

1) MANOVA to look at
  + Main effect by task 
  + Main effect by role model
  + Interaction between task & role mode

2) T-tests comparing 3 control variables (control, difficulty, subjective distance) by condition (e.g. past vs. future, self-control vs. fun)


##Differences from Original Study

###Sample differences

###Setting differences

###Procedure differences

— New questions: manipulation check (did you keep it in mind) & mediator (distance during task); modified other mediator (distance now)

— Added time

— Put demographics at end
— Added “I prefer another term” for gender
— Added an education question
— Did not randomize question order for demo's

- For future, wrote "who you imagine being" rather than "recall being"

##Data preparation

### Step 1: Load packages

[Some useful packages are being loaded below. You can add any additional ones you might need too.]

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(ggthemes)
```

### Step 2: Load data

```{r Load file}

d <- read_csv("data/obrien2015_pilotA_November 14, 2017_10.54.csv")


```

```{r Clean & Filter data}

#Filter out first two rows
d <- d %>%
  filter(!((IPAddress == "IP Address") |
           IPAddress == "{\"ImportId\":\"ipAddress\"}")) %>% #need the backlash to view the quote
  select(contains("DV"), condition, ResponseId)


```


### Step 3: Tidy data

```{r Tidy data}

d.tidy <- d %>%
  gather(dv, dvresponse, contains("DV")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dvresponse)) %>% #filters out n/a responses ; to be tidy, we could modify the dv repsonse label to clean up
  mutate(rolemodel = ifelse(condition == "pastrational","past",
                            ifelse(condition =="pastfun","past","future"))) %>%
  mutate(task = ifelse(condition == "pastrational","selfcontrol",
                            ifelse(condition =="futurerational","selfcontrol","fun")))
  
    

#Make dv response into a numeric

d.tidy$dvresponse <- as.numeric(d.tidy$dvresponse)

#Summarize by task

d.summarized <- d.tidy %>%
  group_by(ResponseId, task, rolemodel) %>%
  summarise(numtrials = sum(dvresponse == 1, na.rm = TRUE))
 
#Convert task & rolemodel to factor

d.summarized$task <- as.factor(d.summarized$task)
d.summarized$rolemodel <- as.factor(d.summarized$rolemodel)

#Make 
d.summarized$numtrials <- as.numeric(d.summarized$numtrials)


```

##Confirmatory analysis


```{r Two-Way ANOVA for Num Trials}

fit <- aov(numtrials ~ task * rolemodel, data=d.summarized)

plot(fit)

summary(fit)

```
