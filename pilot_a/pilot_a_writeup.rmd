#### Overview

Replication of Study 4 by Sample & Sample (2015, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General)

#### Changes to Make For Pilot B

* Stimuli
    + I used the original Qualtrics file that Ed O'Brien sent me. After running my pilot, I noticed that the future self manipulations had the wrong wording. They said "who you recall being" but should say "who you imagine being over the next few years" (as indeed the paper pointed out).
    
* Measures
    + For the question asking how far away the self felt during the task, the item descriptions should have been in past tense ("they felt very close to me") and not present ("they feel very close to me")
    
* Attenion Check
    + Add an attention check? I am not sure what the best attention check is to add
