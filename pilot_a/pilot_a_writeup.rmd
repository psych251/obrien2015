#### Overview

Replication of Study 4 by Sample & Sample (2015, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General)

#### Changes to Make For Pilot B

* Stimuli

* Measures
    
* Attenion Check
    + Add an attention check? I am not sure what the best attention check is to add

* Variable naming
    + Add flowers time & DV

###Sample differences

###Setting differences

###Procedure differences

— New questions: manipulation check (did you keep it in mind) & mediator (distance during task); modified other mediator (distance now)

— Added time

— Put demographics at end
— Added “I prefer another term” for gender
— Added an education question
— Did not randomize question order for demo's

- For future, wrote "who you imagine being" rather than "recall being"

##Data preparation

### Step 1: Load packages

[Some useful packages are being loaded below. You can add any additional ones you might need too.]

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(ggthemes)
```

### Step 2: Load data

```{r Load file}

d <- read_csv("data/obrien2015_pilotA_November 12, 2017_15.56.csv")


```

```{r Clean & Filter data}

#Filter out first two rows
d <- d %>%
  filter(!((IPAddress == "IP Address") |
           IPAddress == "{\"ImportId\":\"ipAddress\"}")) %>% #need the backlash to view the quote
  select(contains("DV"), condition, ResponseId)


```


### Step 3: Tidy data

```{r Tidy data}

d.tidy <- d %>%
  gather(dv, dvresponse, contains("DV")) %>%
  

d.tidy$dvresponse <- as.numeric(d.tidy$dvresponse)


```

##Confirmatory analysis

```{r Sum Data}

d.main <- d.tidy %>%
  group_by(ResponseId) %>%
  summarise(test = count(dvresponse,vars = 1)) #need to exclude blank values

  

```



```{r MANOVA}

```
